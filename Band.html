										<h1>Music style and inspirations</h1>
										<p>The 1975 has been classified as a pop rock band. Scott Kerr
											of AllMusic wrote that the band combined "the dark and youthful themes
											of sex, love, and fear with ethereal alt-rock music."Healy specifically
											cites Talking Heads, My Bloody Valentine, and Michael Jackson as musical
											influences; he states that his greatest influence is the oeuvre of filmmaker
											John Hughes. For their second album, I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are
											So
											Beautiful yet So Unaware of It, Healy cited D'Angelo, Roberta Flack, Boards
											of
											Canada,
											and Sigur Rós as inspirations, saying that they're "a post-modern pop band
											that
											references a million things. I don't even know what my band is half the
											time."Their
											"melancholic" black and white visual aesthetic is juxtaposed with major keys
											and
											what the band calls "classic pop sensibilities."Critics at Pitchfork have
											favourably compared them to the Big Pink. Sex EP was described by Paste as
											"equal
											parts ethereal and synth pop", with "haunting" and "smooth" vocals. Their
											"mellow",
											stripped down style was praised for its lack of "attention-grabbing
											production
											theatrics."</p>
										<p>The 1975 has been described as electropop, funk rock, indie pop,
											indie rock, pop, pop rock and rock. I Like It When You
											Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful yet So Unaware of It has been described as
											indie
											rock and pop.</p>
										<p>Healy has stated that their influence is "heavily rooted" in Black American
											music
											in many interviews</p>
